### Hi there 👋 thank you for visiting my GitHub page.

## 👩‍💻 About me
I'm Haruka and I am passionate about coding and women in STEM. As a former civil engineer, I love the problem-solving aspect of coding, its innovative potential and the continuous learning.
I hope to inspire other women to pursue careers in STEM, particularly in software engineering.

Please see [my portfolio](https://haruka-ogino.vercel.app/) 🙂

## 🔧 Current projects
- 🗺️ [Film Dori](https://github.com/haruka-ogino/film-dori) - an app where users can share real-life locations in Japan, that inspired, have been inspired by, or are somehow related to films and tv shows. It aims to promote travel outside the busy cities dealing with over-tourism. Please see its pinned repo if you would like to learn more about it.
- 👾 [Koda's Arcade](https://github.com/haruka-ogino/koda-arcade) - a front-end app built using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. As I have build several projects using React, TypeScript, Next.js and Tailwind CSS, I wanted to take things back to basics and build an app from scratch to learn what modern frameworks do under-the-hood.

## 🌱 Current learnings
- 📊 SQL queries
- ☁️ AWS

## 🎮 My hobbies
Outside of coding, I enjoy:
- 🐕 going for walks with my dog
- 🧶 punch needling
- ㊫ practicing my Japanese
