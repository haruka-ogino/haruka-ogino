### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ thank you for visiting my GitHub page.

My pronouns are she/her.

I am currently developing 'ghibli-things,' a library with games dedicated to Ghibli films. It encompasses various elements such as characters, locations, houses, and foods featured in the films.

I'm currently learning Object Oriented Programming on JavaScript through my pet-blog project. This is a blog where you can record things about your pet, and also record actions, such as barking for a dog, or hopping for a bunny. All for the purpose of learning!

I am looking for help with learning about databases, both the options out there and which are most suitable for any specific project.
